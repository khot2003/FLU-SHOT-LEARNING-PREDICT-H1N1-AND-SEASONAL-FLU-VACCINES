# EDA on FLU-SHOT-LEARNING-PREDICT-H1N1-AND-SEASONAL-FLU-VACCINES

This repository delves into understanding influenza vaccination behavior, specifically focusing on H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccination. Through an exploratory data analysis (EDA), we analyze the factors influencing individuals' decisions and attitudes towards getting vaccinated.By analyzing key attributes like knowledge about vaccine ,demographic details like age and education level, along with personal opinions and comparisons between the two vaccines, we aim to inform public health campaigns and resource allocation strategies for better influenza preparedness. Ultimately, understanding what drives vaccine acceptance allows us to develop targeted interventions and promote optimal immunization coverage, leading to improved public health outcomes.
