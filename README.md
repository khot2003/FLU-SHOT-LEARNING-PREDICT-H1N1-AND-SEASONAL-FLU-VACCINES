# Flu Shot Learning : Overview of H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines


This repository delves into understanding influenza vaccination behavior, specifically focusing on H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccination. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we analyze the factors influencing individuals' decisions and attitudes towards getting vaccinated. By examining key attributes such as knowledge about vaccines, demographic details like age and education level, along with personal opinions and comparisons between the two vaccines, we aim to inform public health campaigns and resource allocation strategies for better influenza preparedness. 

Furthermore, we utilize various machine learning models to predict individualsâ€™ likelihood of receiving both vaccines, as detailed in our related research. The study highlights the effectiveness of algorithms like Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Neural Networks, emphasizing their potential to inform targeted vaccination strategies. 

Ultimately, understanding what drives vaccine acceptance allows us to develop targeted interventions and promote optimal immunization coverage, leading to improved public health outcomes. The aim of this project is to leverage data-driven insights to enhance vaccine uptake and prepare for future influenza epidemics through informed public health initiatives.

##OBJECTIVES:
To identify the key factors influencing the H1N1 vaccine and Seasonal vaccine.
To apply data visualization techniques to gain insight by generating charts like pie, bar, line, and violin.
To apply Machine Learning techniques to predict if a given individual is vaccinated by H1N1 / Seasonal vaccine or not.
